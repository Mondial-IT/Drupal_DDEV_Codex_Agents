# Mondial-IT - Drupal - SAAS CMS - Codex

___
## Codex and other CLI agent instructions for the development of the Drupal 11 SAAS platform.

These agent instructions detail the specific actions agents can and should take to ensure consistent high quality development of the Drupal 11 SAAS platform as it is in use with our clients.

For developers, it is a starting point and inspiration on how to set up an enterprise AI developed CMS platform with the necessary guard rails and instructions.

Areas where Codex shines:
* Put up general scaffolds of code
* Updating documentation
* Complementing modules with help_topics and .module help
* Updating code commenting
* General setup and operations of DDEV, Composer, Ubuntu environment
* Bug finding and fixing
* Implementation of features, conforming to general rules (style, tooltips, ...)

Areas to be careful:
* Codex has no issue, removing essential pieces of code when it sees fit. Work in small steps and check outcomes.
* Be aware of rabbit holes, when a solution takes over 10 tries, you probably need to rethink what is happening.
* Unit tests are a bit shallow, more work is needed i designing the agent rules



## Drupal 11
Drupal 11 is the latest major release of the open-source content management framework widely used for enterprise websites, portals, and headless content APIs. It builds on the stability and modular design of Drupal 10 while modernizing its core to take advantage of the latest versions of PHP, Symfony, and Twig. The platform provides developers with flexible content modeling, multilingual capabilities, and a mature caching system that can scale efficiently for high-traffic environments. Its focus on API-first design makes it ideal for integration with decoupled frontends, mobile apps, and third-party services.

For DevOps professionals, Drupal 11 introduces improvements that simplify deployment and maintenance. The core system supports configuration management through YAML files, making environment synchronization easier in CI/CD pipelines. Composer-based dependency management is now the default, enabling more predictable builds and security patching. Combined with containerization tools like Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes, Drupal 11 can be deployed, scaled, and monitored as part of a modern cloud-native infrastructure.
